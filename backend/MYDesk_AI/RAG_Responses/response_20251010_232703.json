    "summary": "Method design is important because it helps to ensure that the code is easy to understand, reuseable, and maintainable. A good method should be easy to understand, with clear intent, precise pre and post conditions, cohesive, loosely coupled, and reusable. A method should also be unit-testable, with cohesion, coupling, and complexity managed. A complex method may have more parameters and invoke more external methods, but this does not necessarily mean it is a bad method. A method should be broadly understood, with a clear intent, precise pre and post conditions, cohesive, loosely coupled, and reusable. A method should also be easy to understand, with clear intent, precise pre and post conditions, cohesive, loosely coupled, and reusable.
